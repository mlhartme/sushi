  <p>Command line parsing. A command line consists of options and values Cli is the main class in this package. </p>

  <p>The preferred was to populate commands is via Constructor injection. Because this is the best documentation and it
    yields command objects you can also be used by normal code.</p>

  <p>Rationale: I know there's https://github.com/airlift, but I need context objects and my console with default options
    and exception handling. (And the same for JCommander)</p>
