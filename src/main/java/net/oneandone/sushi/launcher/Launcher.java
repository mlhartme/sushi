/**
 * Configures and executes an operating system process. This class wraps a ProcessBuilder to simplify process execution.
 * In particular, most methods return this so you can configure and execute a program in a single expression
 * (short methods names further simplify this). In addition, you can easily get process output as a string.
 *
 * None-zero exit codes of a process are reported as ExitCode exceptions. This helps to improve reliability
 * because it's harder to ignore exceptions than to ignore return codes.
 *
 * Launcher streams chars, although the underlying process stream bytes. Encoding/decoding is performed
 * according to the specified encoding. If you need to stream bytes with Launcher: pass in the appropriate
 * OutputStreamWriter/InputStreamReader and make sure that their encoding and the encoding for Launcher is
 * ascii. (Rationale: character stream are usually more convenient to use in applications than byte streams
 * because process input/output is usually for humans - and thus has to be converted. To keep things simple,
 * I accept the small performance penalty of also de- and encoding; if this is an issue in your application,
 * you have to fall back to Java's ProcessBuilder.)
 *
 * Note that the first "arg" passed to an instance of this class is actually not an argument, but
 * the name of the program or script to be executed. I accept this inconsistency because it simplifies
 * the api and allows for shorter method names.
 *
 * The executable is searched according to the PATH variables.
